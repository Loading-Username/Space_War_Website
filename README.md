# The Battle For Earth!
## What is Derek's Space War?
Long ago, long before your time, there was a planet called Earth. This game captures the legendary battle for Earth that we know today, in the year 2754. In the real world, Earth was wiped from existence forever. Now, you have a chance to change the fate of Earth. Use your fighter pilot to fend off the invaders that destroyed Earth so long ago, and help this beautiful planet stay alive forever, so maybe one day they could be our allies. One day.

### How to Play
Once you open up The Battle for Earth, press space to start playing. The left arrow key will move you to the left, and the right arrow key will move you to the right. Press space to shoot the lasers from the laser blasters on your ship. Each enemy will take two lasers to kill, while your own ship takes three. Avoid all lasers if possible, and try your best to eliminate the alien invaders. Each time you shoot a laser, your score will decrease by ten points. Each time you land a hit on the alien fleet, your score will increase by a thousand points. Of course, try to get the highest score you can! If your ship is eliminated, you have lost the battle and Earth has been destroyed. If you somehow manage to overcome the odds and beat out the alien fleet, bathe in glory knowing that you saved Earth. Good luck!
